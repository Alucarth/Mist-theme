# Mist
Mist GNOME-Shell theme

Inspired by the look of the GDM3 login manager, the goal is to have a theme that is as fully transparent and out-of-the-way as possible. This means a panel that blends right into the desktop, simple flat, transparent buttons, and the bare minimum when it comes to menus and elements that overlap the workspace.
